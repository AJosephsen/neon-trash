Build a single-screen top-down survival shooter in HTML5 Canvas with NO images. Everything must be vector paths and effects. Implement: player with WASD movement (accel+friction), auto-fire in movement direction, enemies that spawn at edges and home toward player, circle collisions, particles (rings + sparks), score + HP, difficulty ramp, and polished neon rendering using translucent frame clearing for trails + additive blending + shadowBlur glow. Include camera shake on hits, subtle background grid, and a restart key. Keep code in game.js, clean functions (update, render, spawn).”
